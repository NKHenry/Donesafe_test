# Donesafe_test

calculator.py contains the code for the program. calculator_test.py contains tests.

calculator.py expects two arguments, people.json and rules.json. They don't need to be the same name as these
but must have the same format as the original json files given for the test. 

The two programs should be kept in the same directory when running.
